Dear __[name]__,

Thank you so much for your interest in Quant! We are very excited to help you continue your journey into quantitative finance. As part of how we assess our new recruits, we want to invite you to participate in an online, open-note, open-internet assessment to gauge your system design and software engineering proficiency.

This is a holistic assessment, focusing on how you will go about designing systems with an eye for best practices. You will have two weeks to complete the assessment, ending on __[date]__. We will be grading you on your code, documentation, styling, robustness, and git commits. Take the assessment seriously and make sure to document your codeâ€”just as if your project is a part of a larger codebase.
